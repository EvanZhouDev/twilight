# Twilight Core

Twilight Core consists of the parser, interpreter, and output management of the Twilight language. It's what runs the whole thing!

> Twilight Core is the nomenclature for everything under the `lang` directory, not to be confused with `lang/core`, which consists of the lexer, AST definition, and parser.
